# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08)

**Core value:** Reliably turn 3D point clouds into correct, reproducible 2D feature rasters — sound in code and math, running against current PCHandler 2.x + GSEGUtils releases.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Branch Untangling & Mainline Consolidation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Branch Untangling & Mainline Consolidation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-08 — Roadmap created (6 phases, 24 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone 1 is a hardening + adaptation pass (deps, branches, quality/math, bugs, tests, CI/CD, downstream BC).
- CI/CD split: lightweight test-CI early (Phase 3), branch-protection/publication hardening pre-ship (Phase 6).
- Known bugs tracked as explicit requirements, each with a proving test (Phase 5).
- Quality pillar deepened to include mathematical/algorithmic soundness (Phase 4); QUAL-03 findings feed BUG-05.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Requirement-count discrepancy: REQUIREMENTS.md coverage note said "23 total" but there are 24 distinct requirement IDs. Traceability corrected to 24; confirm at next review.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
