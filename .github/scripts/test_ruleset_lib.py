"""Unit tests for `ruleset_lib`'s absent-key guard, trigger-key forms and conditional rule (d).

Plain pytest with inline dict fixtures: no network, no filesystem. Run with::

    python -m pytest .github/scripts/test_ruleset_lib.py -q

The module lives alongside the library it tests so that `import ruleset_lib`
resolves the same way it does for the two CLIs in this directory; the `sys.path`
insertion below makes that work when pytest is invoked from the repo root.

Note that ruff's `per-file-ignores` relax docstring rules under `tests/**` only,
which does not cover `.github/scripts/`, so every test here carries a
numpy-convention docstring by design rather than by accident.
