r"""Gate a ruleset apply on the target branch actually producing every required context.

Invocation, three positional arguments::

    python .github/scripts/preflight_ruleset_apply.py \\
        .github/rulesets/main.json /tmp/target-workflows /tmp/send-payload.json

Called from ``ruleset-apply.yml`` between the step that fetches the TARGET
branch tip's workflow files and the step that sends the update. Reading the
workflows from the target tip rather than from the checked-out ref is the whole
point: dispatching from a stale branch would otherwise cross-reference stale job
names, pass, and break the live gate.

Exits 0 = the payload may be applied, and the send body has been written to the
third argument; exits 1 = refused, and NO send payload exists. Every violation is
accumulated and annotated before the single exit, so one run reports the whole
set rather than the first item.

The check is a containment test -- the payload's required contexts must all be
job names of pull-request-triggered workflows on the target tip. A job of a
scheduled, push-only or manually dispatched workflow never reports a check run on
the pull request a ruleset gates, so its name does not count -- requiring it would
leave the branch unmergeable just as a missing job would. That containment is why it refuses in **both** directions
with one assertion: a payload that adds a context nothing produces, and a target
tip from which a job was removed while a payload still requires it. That is what
makes the same-commit constraint — decompose or rename a check and update the
ruleset payload in the SAME commit — enforceable rather than merely documented.
Under an empty bypass-actor list a branch requiring a check nothing produces is
unmergeable by anyone, including an admin; this gate is what stands between a
dispatch and that state.

Deliberately NOT included: a read-only argv guard rejecting write-capable ``gh``
flags. Such a guard is correct in a purely read-only audit tool; this script
exists precisely to feed a write, so a guard forbidding write verbs cannot serve
it. The read-only property that matters lives elsewhere -- at the drift job's
token mint scope, which is the only place it can actually bind -- and the
integrity properties that matter *here* are this preflight plus the
committed-paths-only restriction below. Do not add such a guard here.

Report on stdout, diagnostics on stderr.
