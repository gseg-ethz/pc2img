"""Unit tests for the apply preflight.

Every case here is one of the behaviours the gate exists to guarantee: that it
refuses in BOTH directions (a context nothing produces, and a job removed while a
payload still requires it), that a refusal leaves no send payload behind for the
workflow's send step to pick up, that an unreadable workflow is a violation
rather than a skip, and that the payload it does emit is a schema-valid request
body rather than a comparison artefact.

Run with ``python -m pytest .github/scripts/test_preflight_ruleset_apply.py -q``
