"""Behavioural tests for the ``classify-changes`` composite action's shell body.

These tests run the **real** step body. It is extracted from
``.github/actions/classify-changes/action.yml`` with a YAML parse and executed under the
platform's OWN invocation -- ``bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail`` -- with the ``gh``
call replaced by a stub, rather than being restated here as a Python reimplementation.

A reimplementation would drift from the shipped shell and then pass while the shipped shell
failed, which is the exact failure shape this file exists to prevent: nothing automated
covers ``.github/actions/`` unless a file like this one does, and an allowlist matching
rule with no standing enforcement is how a required-gate bypass ships unnoticed.

Those four flags are the other half of that claim, and they are load-bearing. GitHub runs
every ``shell: bash`` step as ``bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}``, so errexit is
ALREADY ON before the step's first line and no profile or rc file is read. A harness that
launched the interpreter bare would run the same script with errexit OFF and with whatever
the developer's login files happen to set: it could not detect an errexit-induced abort in
the very step it exists to pin, and its verdict would depend on the machine it ran on. That
gap is why a false premise about this step's shell contract -- that it controls its own
shell options and therefore cannot abort the job -- survived every review pass this kit
went through. Executing the shipped body is only half of running it the way the runner
does; the invocation is the other half.

The bypass, for the record. Membership used to be containment against a space-padded
string::

    case " $ALLOW " in
      *" $changed "*) ;;

which is not set membership. A single changed path whose own *name* contained a space --
``CHANGELOG.md .release-please-manifest.json`` -- padded to a literal substring of
``" $ALLOW "`` and was therefore accepted, so one pull request adding one such file
emitted ``release-artifacts-only=true`` and greened every required status check having
executed nothing. ``test_a_single_path_containing_a_space_is_rejected`` pins that path to
``false`` and fails against the pre-fix shell.

Run with::

    python -m pytest .github/scripts/test_classify_changes.py -q

Note that ruff's ``per-file-ignores`` relax docstring rules under ``tests/**`` only, which
does not cover ``.github/scripts/``, so every test here carries a numpy-convention
docstring by design rather than by accident.
