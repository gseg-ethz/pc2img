"""Shared primitives for the ruleset drift check, the CI self-test and the apply preflight.

A pure library: no ``main``, no argv parsing, no side effects at import. Importers
are ``check_ruleset_drift.py`` (the read path) and ``preflight_ruleset_apply.py``
(the write path), both of which live in this same directory, so a plain
``import ruleset_lib`` resolves through the script directory Python prepends to
``sys.path``.

The comparison contract is enumerated in full in :func:`normalize`. Every field
the comparison drops, re-keys or sorts is named there **and** recorded in the
returned removal list; a key that vanishes without a matching entry in that list
is the failure mode the design exists to prevent.

Deliberately NOT included: a read-only argv guard rejecting write-capable ``gh``
flags. Such a guard is correct in a purely read-only audit tool, but this library
is shared by the read-only drift comparison in ``check_ruleset_drift.py`` and the
write-capable apply preflight, and a library that forbids write verbs cannot
serve the second. Read-only enforcement for the drift comparison lives at the
job level instead, in the token mint scope, which is the only place it can
actually bind. Do not add such a guard here: it would break the apply path
while adding nothing the token scope does not already give.

    **Why this is a hard failure and not a drift finding.** A REST error body is a
    well-formed JSON object, so it parses cleanly and would be handed to
    :func:`normalize` and then to :func:`diff` like any other payload. Compared
    against a committed file it produces differences that describe the envelope
    rather than the protection state -- or, if the caller were ever to treat an
    unreadable read as "nothing to report", no differences at all. **A check that
    cannot read is indistinguishable from a passing one**, which is the exact
    fail-open shape this drift check exists to eliminate. This generalises the
    absent-field rule in :func:`normalize` — an absent ``bypass_actors`` key is a
    hard failure, never an empty list — from one field to the whole payload: an
    absent *whole payload* is a hard failure too, and it gets its own named reason
    so the two are told apart in the log.

    **Discrimination is structural, never textual.** An error envelope carries
    :data:`API_ERROR_ENVELOPE_KEYS` and carries neither of
    :data:`RULESET_IDENTITY_KEYS`; every real ruleset carries both of the latter.
    Matching on message text would break the first time GitHub rewords a string,
    and would be defeated by a ruleset that happened to be *named* something
    error-shaped.

    The raised message has two parts, deliberately: the status and message the API
    actually returned, quoted so the operator sees the real cause rather than this
    module's interpretation of it, followed by a named diagnosis. For the refusal
    status (:data:`RULESETS_UNAVAILABLE_STATUS`) that diagnosis names
    the plan-and-visibility cause, because a template adopter hitting this is on a
    private repository on a plan without rulesets and needs to be told what to do,
    not told that a field is missing.

    Parameters

    Every field this function drops, re-keys or sorts is enumerated here **and**
    recorded in
    the returned removal list. A key that vanishes without a matching entry in
    that list is the failure mode this design exists to prevent.

    Drops (recorded):
      (a) Live-only envelope keys with no committed counterpart at all:
          ``id``, ``node_id``, ``source``, ``source_type``, ``created_at``,
          ``updated_at``, ``_links``, ``current_user_can_bypass``.
      (c) ``integration_id`` on every entry of the inner ``required_status_checks``
          list -- live returns the integer 15368 (the GitHub Actions app), the
          committed files carry JSON ``null``.
      (d) Keys GitHub fills on read that the committed side is silent about.

    Re-keys and sorts (shape-only, no information removed, so not recorded):
      (b) ``rules`` goes from a list of ``{type, parameters}`` objects to a
          mapping keyed on ``type``, because the two sides order the list
          differently and comparing by position would report a difference that
          does not exist.
      (c) The inner ``required_status_checks`` list is sorted on ``context``.
      (e) ``conditions.ref_name.include`` and ``.exclude`` are sorted.

    **Rule (d) is conditional, and must stay conditional.** A read-filled key is
    dropped only when the committed side does not set it, and is compared when
    the committed side does. Dropping unconditionally is safe for a report but
    not for a gate: ``allowed_merge_methods`` reads live as the repository's
    enabled merge methods and is load-bearing for whichever branch model the
    repository enforces — a squash-only branch, say — so an unconditional drop
    would make this check blind to exactly the key that model depends on. That
    is a fail-open, not a simplification.

    **The bypass-actors guard.** Before any comparison, the live payload is
    asserted to carry a ``bypass_actors`` key. GitHub returns that property only
    to a requester with write access to the ruleset, so a read-scoped token
    receives a payload with the key ABSENT -- and an absent key compared against
    a committed ``"bypass_actors": []`` would read as clean. That is a false
    negative on the single field this drift check exists to watch. An absent key
    is therefore a hard failure, never an empty list. Measured, not assumed: a
    token minted at ``administration: read`` does NOT receive the key, and
    ``bypass_actors`` is the only key that differs between a read-scoped and a
    write-scoped read.

    Nothing here is tuned to make the surviving-difference list come out empty.

    ----------
